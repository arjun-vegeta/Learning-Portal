# E-Learning Portal Backend Documentation

## Overview

This backend is built using Node.js with the Express framework and uses SQLite as an offline database. The system supports three types of users: **students**, **teachers**, and **admins**. Each user role has different functionalities and endpoints:

- **Students:**  
  - Register for and drop courses.
  - Mark lectures as watched (which updates streaks).
  - View course details (lectures, notes, and classmates' streaks).

- **Teachers:**  
  - Upload lectures (video files) and notes (documents) for courses.
  - View courses they teach.
  - View lists of students enrolled in their courses along with their streaks.

- **Admins:**  
  - View all teachers and students.
  - Add or delete teacher/student accounts.
  - View detailed information about courses, teachers, and students.

The backend uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization, and Multer for handling file uploads.

## API Endpoints

The backend organizes endpoints into separate route modules for authentication, teacher functionalities, student functionalities, and admin functionalities.

### 1. **Authentication (`routes/auth.js`)**

- **POST /api/auth/register**  
  Registers a new user. Teachers must provide an array of courses they teach.
  
- **POST /api/auth/login**  
  Logs in a user. On success, returns a JWT token along with the user role and ID.

### 2. **Teacher Routes (`routes/teacher.js`)**

*All teacher routes require JWT authentication and that the user's role is `teacher`.*

- **GET /api/teacher/courses**  
  Returns a list of courses taught by the logged-in teacher.

- **POST /api/teacher/courses/:courseId/lecture**  
  Uploads a lecture video for a course. Uses Multer for handling file uploads.

- **POST /api/teacher/courses/:courseId/note**  
  Uploads a note (document) for a course. Uses Multer for handling file uploads.

- **GET /api/teacher/courses/:courseId/lectures**  
  Returns the list of lectures for a given course.

- **GET /api/teacher/courses/:courseId/notes**  
  Returns the list of notes for a given course.

- **GET /api/teacher/courses/:courseId/students**  
  Returns the list of students registered for a course along with their streaks.

### 3. **Student Routes (`routes/student.js`)**

*All student routes require JWT authentication and that the user's role is `student`.*

- **GET /api/student/courses**  
  Returns a list of all courses available for registration (joins with the `users` table to include teacher names).

- **GET /api/student/my-courses**  
  Returns courses the student is registered in, including streak info and teacher names.  
  **Note:** This endpoint must join `student_courses`, `courses`, and `users` to return the teacherâ€™s name.

- **POST /api/student/courses/register**  
  Registers the logged-in student for a course.

- **POST /api/student/courses/drop**  
  Drops a course the student is registered in.

- **POST /api/student/courses/:courseId/watch**  
  Marks a lecture watch for a course. Inserts a record into `watch_history` and updates the streak in `student_courses`.

- **GET /api/student/courses/:courseId/details**  
  Returns details for a course including lectures, notes, and current streak.

- **GET /api/student/courses/:courseId/students**  
  Returns other students registered for a course (excluding the current student) along with their streaks.

### 4. **Admin Routes (`routes/admin.js`)**

*All admin routes require JWT authentication and that the user's role is `admin`.*

- **GET /api/admin/teachers**  
  Returns all teacher accounts with their associated courses.  
  Uses SQL aggregation to return a JSON array of courses per teacher.

- **GET /api/admin/students**  
  Returns all student accounts with their registered courses and streaks.

- **POST /api/admin/user**  
  Adds a new teacher or student. If the role is `teacher`, accepts an array of courses.

## Technologies & Middleware

- **Express:**  
  Provides the web framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.

- **SQLite:**  
  An offline, file-based database used to store all data. The `database.js` file sets up the connection and creates the necessary tables if they do not exist.

- **JWT (jsonwebtoken):**  
  Used for secure authentication. Tokens are issued upon login and verified on every protected route.

- **bcrypt:**  
  Used to hash passwords before storing them in the database.

- **Multer:**  
  Middleware for handling file uploads (for lecture videos and note documents).

- **CORS:**  
  Enabled to allow cross-origin requests between the backend (running on port 5000 or 5001) and the frontend.

---

## Running the Backend

1. **Install Dependencies:**  
   In the `backend` folder, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Create Upload Directories:**  
   Create the directories:
   - `uploads/lectures`
   - `uploads/notes`
3. **Start the Server:**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server listens on port 5000 (or the configured port).
